This is just a fun project for me to test out capabilities of apps script and the script is generated by GPT

So I don't claim any work is done by me and is just my idea to complete it

If you have found any bug you can reach me out at: joushualim@gmail.com

Again, you should assign function to macro on google sheet so it's acutally playable, in my case I have three rectangle shape, 
one is for resetting board, one is for choosing piece, one is for moving piece

All of the chess rules such as en passant, castling, promotion and et cetera is considered

There are more function yet to be implemented and again is just a fun project so feel free to just clone everything and work it on your own




Overall apps script is kinda good for it's own right, being able to integrate with google ecosystem and making API calls, 
there are many limitations to apps script which I would not discuss here but sometimes for task automation there's better alternatives. 
But considering apps script is free, there's not much to complain about.



Happy Scripting :)
